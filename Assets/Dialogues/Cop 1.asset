        bilgerat? I\u2019ll have ye know I be the meanest cutthroat on the seven
        seas, and I\u2019ve led numerous raids on fishing villages, and raped over
        300 wenches. I be trained in hit-and-run pillaging and be the deadliest with
        a pistol of all the captains on the high seas. Ye be nothing to me but another
        source o\u2019 swag. I\u2019ll have yer guts for garters and keel haul ye
        like never been done before, hear me true. You think ye can hide behind your
        newfangled computing device? Think twice on that, scallywag. As we parley
        I be contacting my secret network o\u2019 pirates across the sea and yer
        port is being tracked right now so ye better prepare for the typhoon, weevil.
        The kind o\u2019 monsoon that\u2019ll wipe ye off the map. You\u2019re sharkbait,
        fool. I can sail anywhere, in any waters, and can kill ye in o\u2019er seven
        hundred ways, and that be just with me hook and fist. Not only do I be top
        o\u2019 the line with a cutlass, but I have an entire pirate fleet at my
        beck and call and I\u2019ll damned sure use it all to wipe yer arse off o\u2019
        the world, ye dog. If only ye had had the foresight to know what devilish
        wrath your jibe was about to incur, ye might have belayed the comment. But
        ye couldn\u2019t, ye didn\u2019t, and now ye\u2019ll pay the ultimate toll,
        you buffoon. I\u2019ll shit fury all over ye and ye\u2019ll drown in the
        depths o\u2019 it. You\u2019re fish food now."
